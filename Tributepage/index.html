    <div id="contents">
        <p id="1">The son of a wealthy and prominent Bengali lawyer, Bose studied at Presidency College, Calcutta
            (Kolkata), from which he was expelled in 1916 for nationalist activities, and the Scottish Churches College
            (graduating in 1919). He then was sent by his parents to the University of Cambridge in England to prepare
            for the Indian Civil Service.
        <p id="1">In 1920 he passed the civil service examination, but in April 1921, after
            hearing of the nationalist turmoils in India, he resigned his candidacy and hurried back to India.
            Throughout his career, especially in its early stages, he was supported financially and emotionally by an
            elder brother, Sarat Chandra Bose (1889–1950), a wealthy Calcutta lawyer and Indian National Congress (also
            known as the Congress Party) politician.</p>
        <p id="1">Bose joined the noncooperation movement started by Mohandas K. Gandhi, who had made the Indian
            National Congress a powerful nonviolent organization. Bose was advised by Gandhi to work under Chitta
            Ranjan Das, a politician in Bengal.Bose was soon after deported to Burma (Myanmar) because he was suspected
            of
            connections with secret revolutionary movements. Released in 1927, he returned to find Bengal Congress
            affairs in disarray after the death of Das, and Bose was elected president of the Bengal Congress.
            Shortly
            thereafter he and Jawaharlal Nehru became the two general secretaries of the Indian National Congress.
            Together they represented the more militant, left-wing faction of the party against the more
            compromising,
            right-wing Gandhian faction.</p>
        <p id="1">When the civil disobedience movement was started in 1930, Bose was already in detention for his
            associations with an underground revolutionary group, the Bengal Volunteers. Nevertheless, he was elected
            mayor of Calcutta while in prison. Released and then rearrested several times for his suspected role in
            violent acts, Bose was finally allowed to proceed to Europe after he contracted tuberculosis and was
            released for ill health. In enforced exile and still ill, he wrote The Indian Struggle, 1920–1934 and
            pleaded India’s cause with European leaders. He returned from Europe in 1936, was again taken into custody,
            and was released after a year.</p>

        <p id="1">
            In Nazi Germany Bose came under the tutelage of a newly created Special Bureau
            for India, guided by Adam von Trott zu Solz. He and other Indians who had gathered in Berlin made regular
            broadcasts from the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio beginning in January 1942, speaking in English, Hindi,
            Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Gujarati, and Pashto.A little more than a year after the Japanese invasion of
            Southeast Asia, Bose left Germany, traveling by German and Japanese submarines and by plane, and arrived in
            May 1943 in Tokyo. On July 4 he assumed leadership of the Indian Independence Movement in East Asia and
            proceeded, with Japanese aid and influence, to form a trained army of about 40,000 troops in
            Japanese-occupied Southeast Asia.
        <p id="1">On October 21, 1943, Bose proclaimed the establishment of a provisional
            independent Indian government, and his so-called Indian National Army (Azad Hind Fauj), alongside Japanese
            troops, advanced to Rangoon (Yangon) and thence overland into India, reaching Indian soil on March 18, 1944,
            and moving into Kohima and the plains of Imphal. In a stubborn battle, the mixed Indian and Japanese forces,
            lacking Japanese air support, were defeated and forced to retreat; the Indian National Army nevertheless for
            some time succeeded in maintaining its identity as a liberation army, based in Burma and then Indochina.
            With the defeat of Japan, however, Bose’s fortunes ended.</p>
        <p id="1">A few days after Japan’s announced surrender in August 1945, Bose, fleeing Southeast Asia, reportedly
            died in a Japanese hospital in Taiwan as a result of burn injuries from a plane crash.</p>
